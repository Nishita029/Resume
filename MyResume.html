                <li><h3>Customer Churn Prediction</h3>
                    <p>Developed a machine learning-powered web application that predicts customer churn with an accuracy of 91%.
                        The model was trained on historical customer behavior and demographic data, applying techniques such as feature engineering,
                        encoding, and scaling to ensure robust performance. The web app provides an interactive interface where users can input
                        customer details and instantly receive churn predictions. This project demonstrates the integration of data science, 
                        machine learning, and web development to solve a real-world business problem, helping organizations make proactive
                        decisions to improve customer retention.
